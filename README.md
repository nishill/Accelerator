# Accelerator
> This repository provides a pipeline for inferring human evolutionary accelerated regions. Note, it's primary purpose is to demonstrate and document the code used to identify these regions. The pipeline run by `python run_accelerator.py` has not been thouroughly tested.  

## Dependencies:
> * [HAL](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/hal) 
> * [Phylogenetic Analysis with Space/Time Models](http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/) 

## The pipeline
> This pipeline begins with a HAL file generated from a whole genome [cactus](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus) alignment. It then uses programs from the HAL and PHAST toolkits to infer evolutionary accelerated regions.
