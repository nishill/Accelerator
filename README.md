Phylogenetic Analysis with Space/Time Models

This repository provides a pipeline for inferring human evolutionary accelerated regions. Note, it's primary purpose is to demonstrate and document the code used to identify these regions. The pipeline has not been thouroughly tested by running `python run_accelerator.py`
